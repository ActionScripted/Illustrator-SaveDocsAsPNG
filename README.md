Adobe Illustrator Script: SaveDocsAsPNG
=========================

A simple script to export all open Illustrator files as PNGs into a specific
directory. Meant as a shortcut for those that need to quickly generate bitmaps
without wanting the hassle of doing a Save As... or a Save for Web... for every
file.

Usage
---

* Save all changes to your open files! (explained below)
* File > Scripts > SaveDocsAsPNG
* Choose target directory
* Save/done!

Installation
---
* Copy the JSX file to your Illustrator scripts folder.
  * On a Mac: Applications/Adobe Illustrator [version]/Presets/[locale]/Scripts/
  * On Windows: ...google it


Notes / Warnings / Limitations
---
* Each generated PNG file will be named based on the original file's name and end with *.ai.png -- that's just the way it is right now.
* The Illustrator files are closed once they're saved as PNGs, so SAVE YOUR CHANGES FIRST
